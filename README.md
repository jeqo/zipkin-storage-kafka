```

> Spans collected via different transports are partitioned by `traceId` and stored in a "spans" Kafka topic.
Partitioned spans are then aggregated into traces and then into dependency links, both 
results are emitted into Kafka topics as well.
These 3 topics are used as source for local stores (Kafka Stream stores) that support Zipkin query and search APIs.

[Design notes](DESIGN.md)

[Configuration](autoconfigure/README.md)

## Building

To build the project you will need Java 8+.

```bash
make build
```

And testing:

```bash
make test
```

If you want to build a docker image:

```bash
make docker-build
```

### Run locally

To run locally, first you need to get Zipkin binaries:

```bash
make get-zipkin
```

By default Zipkin will be waiting for a Kafka broker to be running on `localhost:19092`. If you don't have one, 
this service is available via Docker Compose:

```bash
make docker-kafka-up
```

Then run Zipkin locally:

```bash
make run
```

### Run with Docker

If you have Docker available, run:

```bash
make run-docker 
```

And Docker image will be built and Docker compose will start.

#### Examples

There are two examples, running Zipkin with kafka as storage:

+ [Single-node](docker-compose.yml)
+ [Multi-mode](docker-compose-distributed.yml)

### Testing

To validate storage make sure that Kafka topics are created so Kafka Stream instances can be 
initialized properly:

```bash
make kafka-topics
make zipkin-test
```

This will start a browser and check a traces has been registered.

If running multi-node docker example, run:

```bash
make zipkin-test-multi
```
