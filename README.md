```

> Spans collected via different transports are partitioned by `traceId` and stored in a partitioned spans Kafka topic.
Partitioned spans are then aggregated into traces and then into dependency links, both
results are emitted into Kafka topics as well.
These 3 topics are used as source for local stores (Kafka Stream stores) that support Zipkin query and search APIs.

[Rationale](RATIONALE.md)

[Design](storage/README.md)

[Configuration](module/README.md)

## Building

To build the project you will need Java 8+.

```bash
make build
```

And testing:

```bash
make test
```

If you want to build a docker image:

```bash
make docker-build
```

### Run locally

To run locally, first you need to get Zipkin binaries:

```bash
make get-zipkin
```

By default Zipkin will be waiting for a Kafka broker to be running on `localhost:19092`. 

Then run Zipkin locally:

```bash
make run-local
```

To validate storage make sure that Kafka topics are created so Kafka Stream instances can be
initialized properly:

```bash
make kafka-topics
make zipkin-test
```

This will start a browser and check a traces has been registered.

It will send another trace after a minute (`trace timeout`) + 1 second to trigger
aggregation and visualize dependency graph.

### Run with Docker

If you have Docker available, run:

```bash
make run-docker
```

And Docker image will be built and Docker compose will start.

To test it, run:

```bash
make zipkin-test-single
# or
make zipkin-test-distributed
```

### Examples

+ [Single-node](docker/single/docker-compose.yml): span partitioning, aggregation, and storage happening on the same containers.
+ [Distributed-mode](docker/distributed/docker-compose.yml): partitioning and aggregation is in a different container than storage.
+ [Only-dependencies](docker/dependencies/docker-compose.yml): only components to support aggregation and search of dependency graphs.
