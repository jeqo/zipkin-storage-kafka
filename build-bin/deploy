# This script deploys a SNAPSHOT or release version.

# In CI..
#  * trigger pattern for release: tag =~ /^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$/
#    * skip pull requests
#  * trigger pattern for snapshot: tag IS blank AND commit_message !~ maven-release-plugin
#    * skip documentation-only commits (paths-ignore: '**/*.md')
#  * build-bin/configure_deploy must be called before invoking this.
#
# This script primarily helps `.travis.yml` and `RELEASE.md` contain nearly the same contents, even
# if certain OpenZipkin projects need slight adjustments here.
